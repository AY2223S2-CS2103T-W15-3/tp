### Project: Pied Piper

Pied Piper is a desktop address book application used for developing leadership qualities. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability create different types of tasks.
  * What it does: allows the user to create tasks with deadlines of tasks that encompass an event.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can keep track of all upcoming tasks and know how time sensitive each task is.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{Idea for tasks was inspired by the IP}*

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to store tasks.
  * What it does: stores all the tasks created by the user in a list that checks for uniqueness.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it ensures each unique task is not created more than once and also stores each task.

  * Credits: *{UniqueTaskList was inspired by UniquePersonList}*

* **New Feature**: Added the comment on each individual task.
  * What it does: allows the user to comment on the quality of each completed task.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can expand his evaluation of a completed task beyond a score.
