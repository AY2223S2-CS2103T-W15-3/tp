I’m a Y2 CS student. I’m from Singapore and I enjoy getting in calls with friends and playing casual games.

### Pied Piper

I took part in developing Pied Piper, a task management app that helps current and future university student
leaders take charge of their group projects. It allows students to more easily manage their group project, 
and keep track of their teammates' progress while being able to rate their performances upon completion of
their assigned tasks.
